# dungeon.js
Javascript library to display an off-canvas grid of images.

You can see a demo of it by clicking "PREMIUM Zoom" on [any certificate](https://c2gra.de/c/230677633) in the C2G website.

Please keep in mind that this library was written to be used internally in the C2G website, so:
- No documentation is available
- Dungeon.js doesn't properly support images with different aspect ratios (this could be fixed)

So this repository (at least for now) only exists just in case someone can find the code useful.
